# Life Plan

> *Life does not arrive with a map. It unfolds like morning light—uncertain, unrepeatable, and brimming with paths you have not yet imagined.*

**Life Plan** is a pure-frontend companion for the quietly ambitious soul. Tell it what you wish to become, and a chorus of AI agents will help you chart a route—not as prophecy, but as poetry: a living draft of who you might be, written in timelines, tasks, and words you can carry forward.

Every conversation remembers what matters most: **life is uncertain, and that is not a flaw—it is the door to infinite possibility.**

Built on the [Volcengine Ark Doubao Chat API](https://www.volcengine.com/docs/82379/1399008?lang=zh).
